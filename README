This code recreates the game ball lines
This game can be found, e.g., here: http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/braingames/balllines/balllinesAS2.htm

I largely created this game in order to learn to code in Python

I chose it because I thought it would be interesting to create some machine learning to learn to play the game.
(at time of writing I have not yet succeeded in created said machine learning)

A few minor oddities:

Note that if n (the size of the GAMEBOARD) is >=10, then parts of the game might break. (fix this by finding instances of "int(BALL_TO_MOVE_INPUT[0])" and "int(BALL_TO_MOVE_INPUT[2])" adjust appropriately)
(another minor oddity: in the scenario where an incoming ball is going to arrive in the spot which would complete a 5-in-a-row...
... but the incoming ball is of a different colour from the others in the 5-in-a-row....
... and then the user completes the 5-in-a-row by moving a ball...
... then the eliminate_long_rows function will also delete out the incoming ball...
... whereas the original version on the website will leave the incoming ball there.)
